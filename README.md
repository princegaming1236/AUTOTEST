## Introduction

In the world of software development, testing plays a crucial role. Manual testing can be time-consuming and prone to human error. AUTOTEST leverages the power of Generative AI to automate this process. By analyzing web pages in real-time, it generates relevant test cases and scripts that can be executed with ease.

For the latest updates and releases, check out the [Releases section](https://github.com/princegaming1236/AUTOTEST/releases).

## Features

- **Automated Test Case Generation**: Generate test cases based on the structure and content of web pages.
- **Selenium Script Creation**: Automatically create Python scripts that can be executed with Selenium.
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Analyze web pages in real-time to produce accurate test cases.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to use with minimal setup required.
- **Open Source**: Community-driven development with contributions welcome.

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using AUTOTEST to generate test cases and scripts. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the URL**: Enter the URL of the web page you want to test.

3. **Generate Test Cases**: The application will analyze the page and generate a list of automated test cases.

4. **Export Scripts**: Choose to export the generated test cases as Python Selenium scripts.

## How It Works

AUTOTEST uses large language models to analyze web pages. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the process:

1. **Page Analysis**: The tool fetches the HTML structure and content of the specified URL.
2. **Data Extraction**: It identifies key elements such as buttons, forms, and links.
3. **Test Case Generation**: Based on the extracted data, the application generates relevant test cases.
4. **Script Creation**: Finally, it converts these test cases into executable Python Selenium scripts.

This dynamic analysis ensures that the generated tests are both relevant and effective.
